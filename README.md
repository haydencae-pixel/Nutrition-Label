# Nutrition Label ðŸ§¾

This project was built as part of [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).  
The goal was to learn and apply **typography principles** using CSS by recreating a realistic nutrition label. I practiced working with text alignment, font weights, line height, and layout precision to mimic real-world print design in a web format.
